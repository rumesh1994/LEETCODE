Classification:
Generations Based:
    1. Low Level:
        a. Machine Level (first gen)
        b. Assembly Level (second gen)

    2. High Level:
    (Paradigms of programming languages)
        a. Imperative: (third gen)
        (How to do a task: Procedures)
            >Procedural
            >Object Oriented Programming (OOP) (fourth gen)
        b. Declarative: (third gen)
        (What to do: Non-Procedural)
            >Funcational
            >Logical
        c. Problem Oriented 
            >Numerical
            >Symbolic
            >Publishing 

Type Conversions:
    1. Weak typing (Implicit type conversions)
    2. Strong typing (Does not allow data types conversion implicitly)

Runtime Types:
    1. Static and Compiled (Types checked before runtime: Code is translated prior to runtime)
    2. Dynamic and Interpreted (Types arent't checked until execution: Code is translated during execution)
