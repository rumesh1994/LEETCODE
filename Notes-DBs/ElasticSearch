ELK Stack Components:
    In data pipeline, the following are important:
    1. data gathering (aggregation): helps in collecting logs from multiple sources
    2. dat processing (translation): transforms logs into meaningful data
    3. data storage : store data for longer duration to perform analysis 
    Logstash and Beats together work on the first two aspects (Supports collecting logs and metrics) while storage works on the 

    Beats: Data collection and ingestion to ElasticSearch or via Logstash
    Logstash: Data aggregation and processing
    ElasticSearch: Data indexing and storage
    Kibana: Visualisation and Analysis (Dashboard)

Note: For more complicated pipelines, security(nginx) and buffering(redis, kafka) are added.

Use Cases:
    Security Analysis/Logs
    Search (Textual data)
    Operations (Machines health or performance monitoring)
    Market Insights

Elastic Search(ES):
    NoSQL, Real-time distributed anlytics engine, JSON format used for data storage, accesible from RESTful web services.
    Main features are scalability, near real-time and schemaless

Architecture of ES:
    * Clusters are basically Databases
    * Node ia a single instance of ES. Nodes can be considered as several machines(servers) present within these clusters 
    * Index is the analogy for table in Databases. It has different types of documents
    * Shards are the subdivisions in these Indices and act as independent nodes which can be stored in any node.
    * Fields are columns within an index (table)
    * Documents are Rows within an index (table). It is stroed in JSON format.

Key concept of ES:
    Inverted index concept where there is mapping between the a word --> documents as opposed to a document --> words
    ES uses Apache Lucene engine to complete this task.
